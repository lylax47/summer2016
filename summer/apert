Lexical ambiguity and pos tagging

not to be confused with polysemy - same lemma and pos with several meanings (bank)

statistical based hidden markov models 
	- more probable to find a noun after a determinant
	- visible -> word
	- hidden -> hidden states that correspond to possible pos (find most probable path)

ambiguity within same part of speech

when defining a tagset you have to 

learning curve fo models*




RULE BASED DISAMB.

more than one possible analysis of surface form

(Fred Karlsson) - Contraint grammar

cohort - surface form of word with its analyses

naseform - lemma of word


operations:
	REMOVE
	SELECT
contexts:
	0, -1, 2*, 1c (careful)
ex. No two finites verbs in the same clause (two imperatives cannot follow each other)
	(1c V-FIN)
(0 DET): current word can be det
If the word is NP - preceeded by det
RUS -> $$ symbol for unification - write all possible combinations 
	noun should agree with finite verb
	pronouns looking for intersection of possible cases


LEXICAL TRANSFER

Bilingual dictionary (source words with pos and target words with pos)
left to right vs. right to left

using paradigms
	ex. basque - english pis (weight, floor) 
		- num -> likely floor

LEXICAL SEELECTION

source lang -> target lang, context
operation SELECT or REMOVE

LIMITATIONS

no recursive patterns
echo "..." | sed
eco "..." | grep
