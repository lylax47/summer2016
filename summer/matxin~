dependancy analysis tree

translation between distant languages
	freeling for analysis
	

non projective tree sturctures
fst

morph analysis and disambiguation

any ependency parser can be intergrated (adapt output)

apertium tools can be used to make analyser from scratch

TREE STRUC
	-Input sent diveded into sentences and nodes.
	-Set of mand attributes(form,lemma, position, morph info, depend type)
	-as many optional values as wanted
	-optional shallow parsing

TRAN DEP PARSING

	-shift, right-arc, left-arc
	-on traing learn a model to decide what is most suitable transition

MUTTI-WORD IDENT
	-identification fo multi0words makes lexical transfer easier
	-freeling - spanish mult
	-stanford - none, but has token regex
	
simple rules to decide if a head-cild pair are part fo the same chunk.
	-head(prep), child(noun)

improving analysis
	-incorporate a trainable statistical dependancy parser
	-able to train a parse nased on corpus
	-universal dependency treebank
	-more sophisticated chunking tagger

TRANSFER
ambiguous translation with preference order
dic translations allow small structural modification
	source nodes translate several nodes
	source nodes without target equivalent
selection rules based on very local content


BIL DICS
apertium libraries
tags of APERT used to define XML attributes
paradigms used to define tag equivalencies
	allows to use dif tagsets for each lang
	easier to use heterogeneous resources

new XSLT rules fo rtransfer
	flexibility to define transformations in tree
pipeline allows to add specific modules
	verb-transfer
not widely used in stable language pairs
	fw changes in dependency structure

VERB TRANS	
verb phrase very dif
specific module to trans verb phrases

PREP TRANS
more ambiguity
closely related to traget syntax
dif prep depending on verb
	THREE STEPS
		- selction based on local context
		- target lang verb subcategorization
		- verb-prep-noun triplets
